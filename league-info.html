      <h2>The Draft</h2>
      <p>
        Snake style, 45 seconds per pick, and scheduled on the Sunday before the first game of the regular season. 
        Keepers are positioned on the draft board based on which round they were drafted in prior year(s).
      </p>
      <h3>How Draft Order is Calculated</h3>
      <p>
        The top 6 picks (1 &ndash 6) are assigned to the teams that did not make the 2021 playoffs. Positioning is based on the inverse order of the regular season standings &ndash does not include the playoffs.<br><br>
        The bottom 6 picks (7 &ndash 12) are assigned to the teams that made the 2021 playoffs. Positioning is based on the inverse order of the final standings &ndash includes the playoffs.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="charter-keepers">
      <h2>Keepers</h2>
      <p>
        Owners may keep up to 2 players year over year.
        The “keep” option can be used a maximum of two consecutive times on the same player before they are released back into the draft pool.
        Players drafted in the first 3 rounds are restricted and cannot be kept.
      </p>
      <h3>Keeper Draft Positions</h3>
      <p>
        Keepers will be positioned on the draft board according to the round in which they were originally drafted.
        For example, if a team drafted a player in the 8th round and wants to keep him, then that keeper will count as the team&apos;s 8th round selection.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="charter-trades">
      <h2>Trades</h2>
      <p>
        If perceived collusion is an issue, the executive committee will confer with both parties to determine whether it is occurring. 
        The trade will be blocked if both parties do not have reasonable rationale (as determined by the executive committee) to back up the trade.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="charter-scheduling">
      <h2>Scheduling, Scoring, & Playoffs</h2>
      <p>
        There are 3 divisions with 4 teams each and all teams will play each other once, then their division twice. 
        Divisions are reset every year based on last year&apos;s regular season standings. 
        Divisions are for scheduling purposes and are not used to calculate playoff seedings. 
        The top 6 teams with the most wins advance to the playoffs with the top 2 teams getting bye weeks. 
        Each weekly matchup, including the playoffs, is based on head-to-head scoring by starting players. 
        Ties are settled by bench points.
